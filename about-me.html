            <h2>HI THERE!</h2>
            <p>My name is Jo Zhou.
                Prior to UX Design, I‚Äôve worked in market research, sales & marketing, early childhood education and music education.
                ‚Äç
                Everything I‚Äôve done has been in pursuit of understanding people more deeply and fostering moments of empathy.
                ‚Äç
                As a designer, I‚Äôm interested in how to create experiences that are meaningful, memorable, intuitive, and even a bit delightful. üåà
                ‚Äç
                As a human, I‚Äôm frequently spotted staring at  my 8 birds, talking about JDM, taking my FujiFilm everywhere with me and talking about skewered bbq. üç°
                ‚Äç</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Currently, I'm pondering:</h2>
            <p>How can we encourage people to slow down a bit, to listen to their inner voice?
                ‚Äç
                How can we contribute to a world that is with more warmth and more meaningful connections?
                ‚Äç
                How can we help people who struggle to discover their true passions?
                ‚Äç
                How can we lift up the unheard stories of struggle, of shame, of triumph, of process?</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>If you want to know more...</h2>
            <p>I have always been inspired by people.
                ‚Äç
                Throughout my work and my interests outside of work, I saw a recurring pattern in myself of wanting to solve problems, to understand, and to create and share experiences of delight.
                I‚Äôm in love with UX, because I‚Äôve been in a variety of spaces that thrive off of telling people what they should want or need... and it can work, but it can also be better.
                ‚ÄçIt‚Äôs with real human interactions, narratives, and perspectives that really everything can improve.
                
                Design asks how to solve a problem.
                UX asks how people are affected by the problem.
                UX Design is when solutions reflect the context‚Äî the problem, the users, the product.
                People refine design, designs refine people.
                It‚Äôs a symbiotic relationship.</p>
